# RESOLVER — Skill Routing Table

Central routing layer for the skill engine. Every skill on disk MUST be
registered here (enforced by `scripts/check-resolvable.ts`). The orchestrator
matches user input against **Invocation Regex** top-to-bottom and dispatches to
the first match.

| Skill | Invocation Regex | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| feature-chain | `/(?:^\/feature-chain\b)\|(?:build\|implement\|add)\s+(?:a\s+)?(?:new\s+)?(?:feature\|capability)/i` | `skills/feature-chain.md` | Orchestrate design → PRD → TDD → review end to end |

| to-prd | `/(?:^\/to-prd\b)\|(?:write\|create\|generate)\s+(?:a\s+)?prd/i` | `skills/to-prd.md` | Synthesize context + codebase → prd.md |
| tdd | `/(?:^\/tdd\b)\|red[-\s]?green[-\s]?refactor\|test[-\s]?(?:first\|driven)/i` | `skills/tdd.md` | Vertical-slice TDD → plan.md + tdd-log.md |

| simplify | `/(?:^\/simplify\b)\|simplify\s+(?:the\s+)?(?:code\|changed\s+files)/i` | `skills/simplify.md` | Apply reuse, simplification, efficiency, and altitude cleanups to changed code |
| prune | `/(?:^\/prune\b)|(?:deep\s+clean|full\s+quality\s+rework)\s+(?:the\s+)?codebase/i` | `skills/prune.md` | Run all quality review skills and funnel findings into design→PRD→TDD→PR |
| pause | `/(?:^\/pause\b)|(?:pause|checkpoint)\s+(?:the\s+)?(?:session|work)|cache\s+(?:this\s+)?session|save\s+my\s+place|stepping\s+away/i` | `skills/pause.md` | Checkpoint the session into git — write a handoff, commit work in flight, and push so any device can resume |
| resume | `/(?:^\/resume\b)|resume\s+(?:the\s+)?(?:session|work)|pick\s+up\s+where|continue\s+from\s+(?:the\s+)?handoff|load\s+(?:the\s+)?handoff/i` | `skills/resume.md` | Reload a checkpointed session from the pushed handoff and continue from its next steps, cold or cross-device |

| ponytail | `/(?:^\/ponytail\b)|lazy\s+senior\s+dev\s+mode/i` | `skills/ponytail.md` | Lazy-senior-dev generation mode — force the simplest working solution (YAGNI, stdlib first, no unrequested abstractions) |

## Column contract

- **Skill** — slug; MUST equal the directory name under `.claude/skills/` and
  the file name under `skills/`.
- **Invocation Regex** — primary trigger wrapped in backticks. Pipe characters
  inside the backtick span are treated as regex alternation, not column
  separators — write `|` freely. The legacy `\|` escape still compiles
  correctly for backwards compatibility. Each regex MUST begin with a unique
  `^\/<slug>` slash-command anchor — that anchor is the deterministic routing
  key the validator checks for collisions.
- **Path** — the canonical `skills/<slug>.md`. MUST exist on disk and MUST be
  listed in `.github/scaffold-files.txt`. Harness-specific wrappers
  (`.claude/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`, `.cursor/rules/<slug>.mdc`,
  `.agents/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`, `.agent/workflows/<slug>.md`) `@`-include
  this file — edit here, not in the wrappers.
- **Purpose** — one operational sentence. Two skills with near-identical
  purpose fail the MECE check and must be merged via parameterized args.

## Bundled skills

Self-contained Anthropic Agent Skills vendored from upstream — they own their
`SKILL.md` (with its own frontmatter) plus bundled scripts/data/references, and
ship as a single `.claude/skills/<slug>/` tree. Registered here so they are not
flagged as orphaned and are covered by the manifest, but **exempt** from the
prompt-skill wrapper contract: no canonical `skills/<slug>.md`, no
`.cursor`/`.agents`/`.agent` wrappers, no Invocation Regex (the skill's own
`description` drives loading). Claude-harness only.

| Skill | Source (license) | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| drawio-skill | github.com/Agents365-ai/drawio-skill (MIT) | Generate `.drawio` diagrams and export PNG/SVG/PDF/JPG via the draw.io desktop CLI |
| improve | github.com/shadcn/improve (MIT) | Survey a codebase as a read-only senior advisor and produce prioritized, self-contained implementation plans for other agents to execute |
