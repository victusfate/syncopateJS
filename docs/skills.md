<!-- BEGIN_SKILLS_INVOCATION -->
Skills can be invoked individually: `/feature-chain`, `/grill-with-docs`, `/to-prd`, `/tdd`, `/design-review`, `/code-quality-review`, `/skillify`, `/sync-scaffold`, `/create-pr`, `/code-review`, `/simplify`, `/prune`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/hoist-skill`, `/protect-branch`, `/frontend-design`, `/audit`, `/add-linter`, `/ponytail`.

Bundled skills (self-contained Anthropic Agent Skills, Claude harness; loaded by description rather than a slash command): `drawio-skill`, `improve`.
